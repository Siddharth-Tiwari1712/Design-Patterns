// Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that occur in software design. 
// They are guidelines or best practices that help developers solve recurring design problems efficiently and effectively. 
// Design patterns provide a structured approach to design and promote code reusability, maintainability, and flexibility.


// Creational Design Patterns —Imagine you’re at a toy factory. Creational patterns are like the moulds used to create different toys. 
// They define the best way to create objects in your JavaScript programs, ensuring that you’re making them efficiently and in a way that’s best suited for your needs.

// Structural Design Patterns —Think of a Lego set. Structural patterns are like the instructions that show you how to assemble the pieces together. 
// In JavaScript, these patterns help you put together different objects and classes to form larger structures, ensuring everything fits together neatly and efficiently.

// Behavioural Design Patterns —Picture a team sport, like soccer. Each player has a role and a way they interact with other players. 
// Behavioural patterns are like the strategies and play the team uses. In JavaScript, these patterns define how different objects and classes communicate and interact
// with each other, ensuring smooth teamwork and coordination.
